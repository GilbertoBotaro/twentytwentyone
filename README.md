## Contributing


From this point on any new issues should be opened on the WordPress Core Trac instead of at GitHub to save them needing to be transitioned over there manually at a later point.

Please prefix tickets with Twenty Twenty-One: so that they are easy to find and collect with a search or filters. Thank you!
